Install MySQL and Connector:
Ensure MySQL is installed and running on your system. Install the MySQL Connector/Python library if you havenâ€™t already:

bash
Copy code
pip install mysql-connector-python
Create the Database:
You need to create the school database in MySQL before running the script. You can do this using a MySQL client or command line:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE school;
Save the Code:
Save the corrected Python code into a file, e.g., student_registration.py.

Run the Script:
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where student_registration.py is saved. Run the script using Python:

bash
Copy code
python student_registration.py
Follow Prompts:
The script will display a menu. Enter the number corresponding to the action you want to perform (e.g., 1 to show databases).

Ensure that MySQL server is running, and you have the necessary permissions for the root user or adjust the connection parameters as needed.
